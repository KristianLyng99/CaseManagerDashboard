## Changelog
- January 09, 2025. Implemented ajourholddato salary correction system:
  - **Added Ajourholddato column detection** in Excel data parsing to identify salary update dates
  - **Implemented correction logic** that compares ajourholddato dates to identify incorrect salary entries
  - **Automatic salary overwriting** when newer entries have earlier ajourholddato dates than older entries
  - **Business rule implementation**: If entry A has later date but earlier ajourholddato than entry B, entry A's salary is corrected to match entry B's salary
  - **Enhanced debugging** with detailed logging showing correction process and affected entries
  - **Data integrity preservation** stores original salary values before correction for audit purposes
  - System now handles cases where companies report salary changes after the fact, ensuring karens assessment uses correct salary data
- January 09, 2025. Added G-regulation salary detection for normert grunnlagstype:
  - **Enhanced karens assessment** with G-regulation logic for cases where grunnlagstype is "normert" and salary increase violation exists
  - **Threshold violation detection** using actual salary (faktisk l√∏nn) to find periods where salary was below 85% or 92.5% thresholds
  - **Automatic salary identification** for G-regulation: finds normert salary from 1 day before threshold violation end date
  - **Purple UI section** displays G-regulation information with violation end date and correct salary for G-regulation calculation
  - **Business logic compliance** ensures proper salary selection for G-regulation in complex normert grunnlagstype scenarios
  - System now handles the complete flow: detect salary increase ‚Üí check for threshold violations ‚Üí find correct G-regulation salary
- January 09, 2025. Added manual calculation method toggle functionality:
  - **Added manual override buttons** for calculation method selection (Auto/Faktisk/Normert)
  - **Auto mode** uses automatic grunnlagstype detection from sick date entry
  - **Faktisk mode** forces use of L√∏nn/Stillingsprosent columns for all calculations
  - **Normert mode** forces use of L√∏nnN/StillingsprosentN columns for all calculations
